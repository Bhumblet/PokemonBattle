# Pokemon Battle Simulator
In homework 2, you will be simulating simple Pokémon battles. The Pokémon data was collected from https://www.pokemondb.net/ (Links to an external site.). The original assignment was prepared for Data Programming I and has been modified for this course. The data and some helper functions are stored in the file POKEMON.h. Open it in and observe that each Pokémon has the following stats defined in the POKEMON struct. Note that each Pokémon comes from a certain ‘Region’ and has two ‘Types’.  A Pokémon with only one type has ‘None’ as its value for type_2.  The other statistics are:

- HP (short for hit points)
- Attack (the Pokémon’s physical attack)
- Defense (the Pokémon’s physical defense)
- Special Attack
- Special Defense
- Speed
